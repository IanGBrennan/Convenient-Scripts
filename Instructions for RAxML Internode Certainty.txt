Caculating Internode Certainty and Tree Certainty using RAxML
	Requires:
		+ "BEST_TREE" - tree with preferred topology (ASTRAL or starBEAST most likely) 
		+ "COMPARISON_TREES" - set of trees to check for consistency in (bootstrap replicates, independent gene trees)
		+ Dendroscope (to view output tree with branch values)
[drag/drop raxmlHPC-PTHREADS-SSE] -f i -T 8 -t BEST_TREE -z COMPARISON_TREES -m GTRGAMMA -n outfilename
