Galaxy directions:

register account

First step is downloading galaxy:
https://galaxyproject.org/admin/get-galaxy/
easiest way is dropping it into your terminal:
$ git clone https://github.com/galaxyproject/galaxy.git

Galaxy is finicky about the version of python you have installed
so, quickly check with: 
$ python --version
if it comes up as '3.x' then you'll have to make a work-around for using python 2.7
that can be found here:
https://galaxyproject.org/admin/python/

Once you've got it up and properly directed, open a terminal window
$ cd /Users/YOUR.DIR/galaxy
then execute galaxy with:
$ sh run.sh
this should bring up the network version, with a final line saying
"serving on http://127.0.0.1:8080"
copy the "http:...." portion and open in a new internet browser window
you should now be able to download tools from the toolshed

sh run.sh --daemon
