Manceau Framework:
	+ basis is a linear stochastic differential equation:
	dXt = (a(t)-AXt)dt+Γ(t)dWt
		- where:
		a is a vector of Rⁿ (n being the number of trait values at a given time, so 1 per lineage)
		A is a constant square matrix of size RⁿxRⁿ
		Γ is a square matrix, same size as A, with varying coefficients (through time)
		Wt is a vector of n Brownian Motions
		- the deterministic part:
			(a(t)-AXt)dt
			explains the effects of trait values on their evolution
			e.g. a lineage's value on itself (OU) or on another lineage (PM)
		- the stochastic part:
			Γ(t)dWt
			explains the drift (BM ~ Wt) and environmental noise influencing (trait) evolution

		other variables:
			τ is a branching time τ0 is the root (1 lineage), τT is the present (all surviving)
			nt is the total number of lineages existing within an epoch (period)
