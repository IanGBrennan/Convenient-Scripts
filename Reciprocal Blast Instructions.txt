Reciprocal Blast Directions:

Start by pulling out all the sequences for a single species, we have Acrochordus_javanicus overlap in both AHE sets
move to the directory with the alignments 
$ cd Google.Drive/ANU..../Acrochordus.seqs

then pull out all the sequences and paste em to a separate file
$ cat *.txt |grep 'Acrochordus_javanicus' >> T222.Acrochordus.seqs.txt

this doesn't preserve the file names (which are the loci numbers)
we need those for comparison, so we'll pull the file names
however, Acrochordus may not be in every single alignment, so we have to search for ones it is definitely in:
$ find . -name "*T222*" -exec grep -l 'Acrochordus_javanicus' {} + > loci.names.txt

open the loci.names.txt file and then past it into the file with the sequences
option+drag down and paste a > before each locus name
then replace the tab between the name and sequence with a return....boom! fasta format
